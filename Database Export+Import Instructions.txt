	"set search_path to "MarriottSchema"" to change search path to what we need to view table

PGAdmin 4 Instructions: 
	To create a copy of the database's data current data, open the directory tree
	until you get to the MarriottCustomer table, from there you can export the data as 
	a CSV file. 
	To then upload this data back to the table, you will need to delete 
	all of the data currently in the table so that you don't get a 
	duplicate key error. To do this, in PSQL go to the table and type 
	"delete from "MarriottCustomer"". Then you can import the CSV file 
	with no problem.
